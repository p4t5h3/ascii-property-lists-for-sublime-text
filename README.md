# Old-Style ASCII Property Lists Support for Sublime Text

This is the syntax definition for [Old-Style ASCII Property Lists](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/PropertyLists/OldStylePlists/OldStylePLists.html).
That is an outdated property list format like Xcode still uses it in its project files.
