# Old-Style ASCII Property Lists Support for Sublime Text

This is the syntax definition for [Old-Style ASCII Property Lists](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/PropertyLists/OldStylePlists/OldStylePLists.html).
That is an outdated property list format like Xcode still uses it in its project files.
Sometimes one has to jump in those and edit them in the text format they are.
This syntax definition improves readability by enabling coloring.
